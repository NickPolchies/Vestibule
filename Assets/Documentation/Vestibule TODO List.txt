Doors that are in the opposite state of their linked door should disable their portal
	This means doors can never lead to nowhere
	The door should re-enable if the state is made to match again
	The door should not modify the state of the linked door if the current state does not match
When heading backwards through a portal active in the other direction, don't teleport the player
